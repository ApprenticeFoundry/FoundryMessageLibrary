// What do I always want to know about the weapon?
// When it is brought up to "low ready"
// When it is brought up to "high ready"
// When it fires (and I want to calculate remaining ammo)
// When there is a mag change
// Where is is pointing (pretty much always because there could be accidental discharge incidents even in training, and we can help pinpoint what went wrong after action, etc)
// When the VictoR recognizes a target
// Estimated range to target (I want to try to calculate where that target goes on my COP)
// Recognition data from the target after a shot (what did we just hit? DID we hit?)
